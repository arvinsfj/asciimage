Hello! My name is Cheng Ze. You can call me Arvin. I was born in 1980s. I live in Shanghai, China with my soulmate. I work at aifuwo as an Project Manager (or Senior Software Engineer) on the iOS Development team. I love programing and am usually busy with side projects or software hacking. My favorite languages are Go and Python, but I have broad experience with many languages and technologies. Much of my computing interest is geared toward graphics, 3d render, emulator, os, hacking. In spare time, I like reading, gardening, 80's game, hacking and all kinds of music.<http://arvinsfj.github.io>
